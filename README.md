## :fire: Updates
* `Feb 28, 2024` Our work has been accepted by [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰, the code and data will be coming soon.

## :mag: Overview
> To evaluate the understanding capability of visual-language models on fine-grained concepts, we propose a new benchmark, SPEC, 
> which consists of six distinct subsets, distributed across the dimensions of Size, Position, Existence and Count.
> Each test case consists of an image candidate set, which differs only in certain visual concept, and a text candidate set, 
> which differs only in corresponding language concept.

## :memo: TODO
- [ ] Release the demo of our data synthesize pipeline
- [ ] Release the data of SPEC benchmark
- [ ] Release the evaluation code of SPEC
